# P5

A framework for PHP5 beginners

## Quick Introduction
P5 is a beginner level framework, which is intended as a learning point for newcomers to the world of PHP5 ( or even web development )
It tries to maintain its minimalist codebase, while giving as much knowledge about good programming practices to beginners,
as well as help them understand the basics of a web application framework.
Ideally, P5 is developed to help promote beginners to use more robust and mature frameworks for their development overtime.
