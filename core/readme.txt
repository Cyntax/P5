You can modify files inside any folder in here, except the 'p5' folder.

Well, actually you can do that too, but try that once you are good at changing the code
in other folders :)

A word of advise: if you ever REALLY want to change the code in 'p5' folder, then you should
re-evaluate the situation and work out by doing changes in the classes folder first.
