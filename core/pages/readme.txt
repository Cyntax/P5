Files contained in here are simple php files, which are loaded by the application
on demand, depending on the url called.

If you want to convert this simple logic into some particular pattern, like MVC,
you should think about the idea and implement it in such a way that you won't need to alter
any core files in the application (Yes, it is possible!)
